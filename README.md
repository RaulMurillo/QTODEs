# Lecture notes in Qualitative Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations

This is a translation from Polish to English of the Lecture Notes belonging to Mr. Henryk Zoladek (http://mst.mimuw.edu.pl/wyklady/rrj/wyklad.pdf). I must thank him sharing with me the original source code and the pictures from the Polish version.   
The current document has been written on my own, with the help of [Google Translator](https://translate.google.com) tool. This version is then revised after the original version and many errata have been corrected. However, due to my ignorance of the Polish languaje, the text is susceptible to some translation errors/misleadings. I apologize for that and hope that the reader finds the text understandable.
